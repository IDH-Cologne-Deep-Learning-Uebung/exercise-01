# Exercise 1: Setting Up

Welcome to the class [Deep Learning](https://lehre.idh.uni-koeln.de/lehrveranstaltungen/wintersemester-2023-2024/deep-learning/)! This is the first exercise, and its goal is to prepare the exercise submission procedure.

## Step 1
Please register on GitHub. If possible please use your Unikim name as username. I will add your account to the GitHub organization [IDH-Cologne-Deep-Learning-Uebung](https://github.com/IDH-Cologne-Deep-Learning-Uebung), which is the umbrella for this and all future exercises. Starting in exercise 2, you will submit exercises on GitHub. Enter your Github username, your real name, your matriculation number and your email address in this [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WGK87XckHrmd2115IP7SgNHbBDykMQAZYHp1Du0yThM/edit?usp=sharing) so that I can assign the commits to the right person and add you to the organization.

## Step 2
The web page [https://learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org) offers a nice tutorial for branching with git. Please follow the first two levels of the "Introduction Sequence". Please note that the web app *only* contains the git part -- in reality, you'd still edit your files (outside of the git realm).
